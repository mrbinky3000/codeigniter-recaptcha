ReCAPTCHA
=========

This is a simple port of Google's port of the ReCAPTCHA library converted to a
CodeIgniter library.  I claim no awesomness for adding a few brackets and 
public or private before function names.  Just thought someone would find this
useful and/or a time saver. I mainly did this to learn how to make and publish 
sparks.

For documentation go to:
http://code.google.com/apis/recaptcha/docs/php.html

Just keep in mind that all of the "functions" in the documentation are now
methods in the Recaptcha class.  So, in the documentation...

> recaptcha_get_html();

... becomes ...

> $this->recaptcha->recaptcha_get_html();

... in your controller
